            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white wine vinegar, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
            <li>2 pounds frozen crinkle-cut French fries</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>1/2 red onion, diced</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Cheese Sauce</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>2 ounces Cheddar cheese, grated</li>
            <li>2 ounces pepper Jack cheese, grated</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped Italian parsley, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut skirt steak into 4-inch long chunks and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add garlic, salt, black pepper, 1 tablespoon vinegar, and 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to a bowl and whisk to combine. Add steak and toss thoroughly until evenly coated. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 12 hours. For best results, toss steaks occasionally to ensure even marination. </li>
            <li>Before using, remove steak from marinade and use a spoon to scrape off any garlic from the surface. Place steaks and reserved garlic back in the refrigerator until needed.</li>
            <li>Bake French fries according to package directions on a foil-lined baking sheet. The entire bag can be baked at once on a single sheet pan, but about 10 extra minutes cooking time may be needed (once baked, fries can be reserved, and reheated in a 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). oven for 10 minutes until hot and crisp).</li>
            <li>Add remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to a pan, and set heat to high. Add diced peppers and onions, and cook, stirring, until onions start to take on some color and turn translucent, a few minutes. Remove from heat and transfer into a bowl. Stir in 1 tablespoon white vinegar. Reserve at room temperature until needed.</li>
            <li>Place the same pan back over medium-high heat, and melt 2 tablespoons butter. Transfer steaks into the pan, and cook about 4 minutes per side or until they reach your desired doneness. The heat can be turned down to medium once the meat starts to brown. When steaks are done, transfer onto a plate, and reduce the heat to low. Cover steaks loosely with foil, and set aside until needed.</li>
            <li>Add reserved garlic to the pan, and cook, stirring, for about 30 seconds, just to take off the raw edge. Transfer in 1 tablespoon butter and 1 pinch salt; stir until melted. Turn off heat; reserve in a warm spot until needed.</li>
            <li>For cheese sauce, add cream, cayenne, and salt to a saucepan. Bring cream to a boil over medium-high heat, whisking occasionally so it doesn't boil over. Cook for 1 minute to reduce slightly. Add in grated Cheddar and pepper Jack cheeses, turn off the heat, and whisk until cheese melts and a smooth sauce forms. Turn off heat and reserve in a warm spot until needed.</li>
            <li>Slice steak chunks across the grain into thin strips. Stir any accumulated juices from the plate steaks were resting on into garlic butter.</li>
            <li>To serve, divide hot French fries into 4 bowls. Top with sliced steak, and spoon garlic butter over. To finish, top with cheese sauce, pepper onion mixture, and chopped Italian parsley.</li>
